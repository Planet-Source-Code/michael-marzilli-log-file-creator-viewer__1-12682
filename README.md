## Log File Creator/Viewer


</div>

### Description

I wrote this Code to Log actions within a game that I'm writing (keep track of Users logging in, out, etc).

This project has a procedure that will add a line of text to a Log File; with time stamp. It also has a Log File viewer, complete with search capabilities.

Search by Date/Time, User#, Type of Log Entry and String.

You can use the Log Form in your application. The Project is heavily documented.
